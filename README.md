# 42-Philosophers
This project Philosophers is a hands-on exploration of multithreading and mutex usage. It involves coding a simulation where philosophers sit around a dining table, managing threads, mutexes, and the risk of simulated starvation. The focus is on creating threads, ensuring thread safety using mutexes, and implementing a real-time simulation.
